# Smart-Task-Schedule
The add-on will ask the user to enter the tasks he must perform on a certain day along with the time required for each task. The plugin will then ask the user how much free time they actually have that day. The plugin will offer a plan for performing the tasks according to the free time, when it adjusts the order of the tasks to the free time.
